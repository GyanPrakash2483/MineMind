harmful to the health of persons.
(2) For the purposes of this regulation, a place shall not be deemed to be in a harmless state for person to
work or pass or remain therein if the eight hours time-weighted average concentration of airborne
respirable dust in milligrams per cubic meter of air sampled by dust sampler of a type approved by and
determined in accordance with the procedure as specified by the Chief Inspector by a general or special
order, exceeds two, where working is being made wholly in a coal seam or where free respirable silica
present is less than five per cent. and the value arrived at by dividing the figures of ten with the percentage

work situation wherein it is technically not feasible to reduce the respirable dust concentration below the
permissible limit or during the time period necessary to install and commission any device or to institute
any new work practice for dust prevention or suppression, compliance with the permissible limit of dust
may be achieved by remote operation or by job rotation and failing which by the use of suitable dust
respirator.
(12) The owner, agent or manager of every mine where need of dust respirators might arise, shall provide
dust respirators in sufficient number and at no cost to the concerned work persons for their use; for the dust
respirators to be regularly cleaned, disinfected and maintained in efficient working order, and for the proper
